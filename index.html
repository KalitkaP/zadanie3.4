    <h1>All That She Wants</h1>
    <h2>Ace of Bace</h2>

    <p>
      She leads a lonely life<br />
      She leads a lonely life<br />
      When she woke up late in the morning light<br />
      And the day had just begun<br />
      She opened up her eyes and thought<br />
      "Oh, what a morning"<br />
      It's not a day for work<br />
      It's a day for catching tan<br />
      Just lying on the beach and having fun<br />
      She's going to get you<br />
      All that she wants is another baby<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah<br />
      All that she wants is another baby<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah<br />
      So if you are in sight and the day is right<br />
      She's the hunter, you're the fox<br />
      The gentle voice that talks to you<br />
      Won't talk forever<br />
      It is a night for passion<br />
      But the morning means goodbye<br />
      Beware of what is flashing in her eyes<br />
      She's going to get you<br />
      All that she wants is another baby<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah<br />
      All that she wants is another baby<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah (is another baby, yeah)<br />
      Ahh<br />
      Ahh<br />
      All that she wants is another baby (is another baby)<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah (is another baby, yeah)<br />
      All that she wants is another baby (is another baby)<br />
      She's gone tomorrow, boy<br />
      All that she wants is another baby, yeah (is another baby, yeah)<br />
      All that she wants<br />
      All that she wants
